          16,17-dimethoxy-5,7-dioxa-13-azoniapentacyclo[11.8.0.02,10.04,8.015,20]henicosa-1(13),2,4(8),9,14,16,18,20-octaene

        <p class="detail-paragraph">
          Berberine is a naturally occurring bioactive compound classified as an alkaloid, known for its bitter taste and vibrant yellow color. 
          It is found in various plants, including barberry, goldenseal, Oregon grape, and tree turmeric, and has a long history of use in traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine.  
        </p>

        <p class="detail-paragraph">
          Modern scientific research suggests berberine may offer several health benefits, although many studies are preliminary or require further high-quality research to confirm effectiveness and safety. 
        </p>

        <ul class="detail-list">
            <li>Blood Sugar Control: Berberine can significantly lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing sugar production in the liver. Some studies suggest it may be as effective as certain prescription diabetes medications like metformin.</li>
            <li>Cholesterol and Heart Health: It may help lower total cholesterol, LDL ("bad") cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, while potentially increasing HDL ("good") cholesterol. This can contribute to a reduced risk of heart disease.</li>
            <li>Weight Management: By activating an enzyme that regulates metabolism and energy levels (AMPK), berberine may support modest weight loss and a reduction in body fat.</li>
            <li>Gut Health and Anti-inflammatory Effects: Berberine has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties that can help balance gut bacteria and may reduce inflammation throughout the body.</li>
            <li>Other Uses: It has been traditionally used to treat infections, skin diseases, and digestive disorders. A gel form may also be effective for canker sores. </li>
