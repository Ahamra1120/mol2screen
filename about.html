            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                We are a team of five students from MAN 13 Jakarta who are passionate
                about addressing challenges in chemistry and health education.
                Mol2Screen is designed to be responsive, informative, and user-friendly.
                Functional and field tests demonstrated that the system performed well
                and achieved an average user satisfaction score of 4.78 out of 5,
                categorized as "Very Good". This confirms that the platform is suitable
                as a modern and interactive supplementary learning medium.

            <h1>Our Vision and Motivation</h1>

            <p>
                This project was initiated in response to several key challenges in
                learning new chemical compounds:
                <br><br>
                1. Lack of Interactive Resources: Students face limited learning
                resources and lack of interactive barriers when learning about new
                chemical compounds.
                <br><br>
                2. Difficulty in Visualization: Students often struggle with abstract
                chemistry concepts and have low spatial ability, particularly in visualizing
                intermolecular interactions at the submicroscopic level.
                <br><br>
                3. Need for Innovation: There is a need for innovative, visual, and
                interactive learning media to understand the structure, properties,
                and therapeutic potential of new bioactive compounds.
                <br><br>
                Our vision is to create an accessible learning platform that not only
                solves social-educational problems but also honors and supports the nation’s inventiveness.

          <h2>Mol2Screen</h2>
          <p>
              We developed Mol2Screen, a web-based digital learning platform focusing on 
              chemical compounds as diabetes therapy. The platform was developed using the 
              Waterfall development model. <br><br>
              Mol2Screen is an educational project designed to promote scientific understanding. 
              The information presented is not meant for medical or commercial use.
