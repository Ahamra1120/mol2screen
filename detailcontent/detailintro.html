    <h1>Indonesian Scientists Discover Compound That Could Transform Diabetes Treatment</h1>
    <div class="detailintro-article">
        <p> Two young Indonesian scientists have captured global scientific attention with the discovery of a new compound that could be a game-changer in diabetes treatment. 
            Juan Leonardo and Fahrul Nurkolis introduced a compound named Juanleoxy Fahrulanoside (C12H23NO9), a breakthrough rooted in local biodiversity yet designed for global impact.
            The compound is now officially registered with the National Library of Medicine and is in the process of being patented. 
            Working through the GLP-1 modulator pathway—a crucial receptor in human metabolism—the compound helps lower blood sugar after meals, enhances satiety, and supports metabolic health.
            This innovation opens the door for safer, more effective diabetes therapies inspired by Indonesia’s natural wealth.

        <h2>From Traditional Herbs to Modern Discovery</h2>

        <p> 
            The research began with Delites, a traditional Chinese herbal formula long used in Indonesia. Juan and Fahrul took it a step further, combining traditional knowledge with modern science. 
            They applied bioinformatics, in silico screening, and metabolomic validation to identify promising compounds.
            The results were striking. Juanleoxy Fahrulanoside proved effective in targeting the GLP-1 pathway, essential for controlling blood glucose and energy metabolism.
            Laboratory tests confirmed significant improvements in metabolic markers. 
            To cement its credibility, the findings were published in Frontiers in Nutrition (Switzerland), a top-tier Scopus Q1 scientific journal.

        <h2>Research Challenges: Limited Resources, Unlimited Creativity</h2>
        <p>
            The road to discovery was far from easy. Since 2022, the duo invested significant time, effort, and funding into their project. 
            They worked through compound characterization, early in vitro studies, and animal experiments.
            Their biggest obstacle lay in the limited research facilities in Indonesia—from lack of advanced instruments to insufficient long-term funding. 
            Yet, instead of halting progress, they turned constraints into opportunities. 
            By creatively maximizing local resources and fostering international collaborations, Juan and Fahrul pushed their work to world-class levels. 
        </p>
        <h2>From the Lab to Paris</h2>
        <p>
            Their hard work was rewarded when they were invited to speak at the International Congress of Nutrition (ICN) 2025 in Paris. 
            This prestigious quadrennial forum, hosted by the International Union of Nutritional Sciences (IUNS), 
            is recognized by UNESCO and WHO and received direct support from French President Emmanuel Macron.
            For Indonesia, this was a historic milestone. Few young researchers from the country have had the chance to stand on such a global stage. 
            Having their abstract selected by ICN marked not only personal achievement but also national pride.
