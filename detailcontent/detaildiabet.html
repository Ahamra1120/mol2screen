          Diabetes is a condition that happens when your blood sugar (glucose) is too high. 
          It develops when your pancreas doesn’t make enough insulin or any at all, or when 
          your body isn’t responding to the effects of insulin properly.
          Diabetes affects people of all ages. 
          Most forms of diabetes are chronic (lifelong), and all forms are manageable with medications and/or lifestyle changes.

        Glucose comes from carbohydrates in food and drinks and serves as the body’s main energy source. 
        It needs insulin — the “key” hormone — to enter cells. 
        When the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin or the body 
        can’t use it properly, glucose builds up in the blood, causing high blood sugar (hyperglycemia).

      <h1>What are The Types of Diabetes?</h1>
      <br>
      <p>There are several types of diabetes. The most common forms include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p> 
              <b>Type 2 diabetes:</b> With this type, your body doesn’t make enough insulin and/or your body’s cells don’t respond normally to the insulin (insulin resistance). 
              This is the most common type of diabetes. It mainly affects adults, but children can have it as well.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Prediabetes:</b> This type is the stage before Type 2 diabetes. 
              Your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be officially diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Type 1 diabetes:</b> This type is an autoimmune disease in which your immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells in your pancreas for unknown reasons. 
              Up to 10% of people who have diabetes have Type 1. It’s usually diagnosed in children and young adults, but it can develop at any age.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Gestational diabetes:</b> This type develops in some people during pregnancy. 
              Gestational diabetes usually goes away after pregnancy. However, if you have gestational diabetes, you’re at a higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life.
            </p>

      <h1>How Common is Diabetes?</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        Diabetes is very common, with over 800 million adults worldwide living with the disease, a number that has more than quadrupled since 1990. 
        In 2022, this represented 14% of the global adult population, up from 7% in 1990. Projections indicate this number will continue to rise significantly. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Diabetes facts and figures show the growing global diabetes burden for individuals, families and countries. 
        The latest International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Diabetes Atlas (2025) reports that 11.1% – or 1 in 9 – of the adult population (20-79 years) is living with diabetes, 
        with over 4 in 10 unaware that they have the condition. Over 90% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes, which is driven by socio-economic, demographic, environmental, 
        and genetic factors. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reports that about 537 million people worldwide have diabetes. 
        The number of cases has been increasing over the past few decades, and the IDF predicts 783 million people will have diabetes by 2045 — an increase of 46%.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Based on the 2023 Indonesian Health Survey (SKI), the prevalence of diabetes for those aged 15 and above, based on blood sugar checks, is 11.7%. 
        This is an increase from the 10.9% reported earlier. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reported that as of 2021, 
        Indonesia ranked 5th globally for the number of people with diabetes.
